@article{AndreFaroni,
	abstract = {We study the home bias in a dynamic consumption and portfolio choice problem where the in- vestor is ambiguous about stock returns but learn about their distributions. The investorâ€™s preference is modeled with the generalized recursive smooth ambiguity model of Ju and Miao (2012) that is able to separate among risk aversion, ambiguity aversion, and intertemporal substitution. To solve this problem, we develop a numerical approach which extends the existing ones to tackle the specificities of our framework. Our results show that ambiguity averse investors participate less in financial mar- kets and have a higher home bias compared to ambiguity neutral decision makers. However, learning increases market participation and reduces the home bias which does not disappear due to the finite investment horizon. We finally provide comparative statics for risk aversion, ambiguity aversion and the learning process.},

@article{AndreTavin,
	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the problem of an investor facing ambiguity with respect to dependence between risky assets. The problem we consider is a portfolio optimisation problem in a one-period market with risky assets. We formalize and study the corresponding decision problem under ambiguity aversion. We show how this problem can be approximated with Bernstein copulas. The approximated version can then be solved using numerical optimisation routines. We illustrate the robustness of the obtained portfolios in a numerical study.},
