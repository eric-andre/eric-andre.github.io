@article{AndreSchneiderTavin22a,
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a methodology for measuring information flows underpinning option price movements, and for analyzing the distribution of these flows. We develop a framework in which flows of information can be measured in terms of relative entropy between risk-neutral distributions obtained from implied volatility data at different dates. We set up a numerical methodology to compute such quantities from empirical market data corresponding to options written on the S&P 500 index. This methodology uses Normal Inverse Gaussian distributions for the log-return of the index. We apply our method to six years of daily data, from 2015 to 2021. In our results, options with short maturities catch a greater share of new information. We also analyze the distribution of the obtained information flows with a mixture of two exponential distributions. This mixture works with one component corresponding to frequent small values and the other to less frequent high values.},

@article{AndreCoqueret22a,
	abstract = {This article aims to enhance factor investing with reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The agent learns through sequential random allocations which rely on firms' characteristics. Using Dirichlet distributions as the driving policy, we derive closed forms for the policy gradients and analytical properties of the performance measure. This enables the implementation of REINFORCE methods, which we test on a large dataset of US equities. Across a large range of parametric choices, our result indicates that RL-based portfolios are very close to the equally-weighted (1/N) allocation. This implies that the agent learns to be agnostic with regard to factors, which can partly be explained by cross-sectional regressions showing a strong time variation in the relationship between returns and firm characteristics. All in all, our results contribute to a nascent stream of literature that relativizes the usefulness of mainstream characteristics in asset pricing models.},
