@article{AndreTavin,
	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the problem of an investor facing ambiguity with respect to dependence between risky assets. The problem we consider is a portfolio optimisation problem in a one-period market with risky assets. We formalize and study the corresponding decision problem under ambiguity aversion. We show how this problem can be approximated with Bernstein copulas. The approximated version can then be solved using numerical optimisation routines. We illustrate the robustness of the obtained portfolios in a numerical study.},

@article{Andre23a,
	abstract = {This letter applies Siniscalchi (2009)’s Vector Expected Utility to introduce ambiguity aversion into factor models for assets’ returns. The resulting criterion is tractable and its adjustment for ambiguity vanishes as initial wealth increases. Finally, it can be related to shrinkage estimators which are used to estimate covariance matrices.},

@article{Andre22a,
	abstract = {This letter develops a decision criterion which takes into account parameter and model uncertainty in an optimal portfolio choice problem. This criterion is a special case of the Variational Preferences, rewritten in the Bayesian statistics notations, which specifically exploits the information contained in an observed sample of assets’ returns. I provide an example to illustrate its properties and to highlight its differences with the closely related Multiplier Preferences.},

@article{AndreCoqueret22a,
	abstract = {This article aims to enhance factor investing with reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The agent learns through sequential random allocations which rely on firms' characteristics. Using Dirichlet distributions as the driving policy, we derive closed forms for the policy gradients and analytical properties of the performance measure. This enables the implementation of REINFORCE methods, which we test on a large dataset of US equities. Across a large range of parametric choices, our result indicates that RL-based portfolios are very close to the equally-weighted (1/N) allocation. This implies that the agent learns to be agnostic with regard to factors, which can partly be explained by cross-sectional regressions showing a strong time variation in the relationship between returns and firm characteristics. All in all, our results contribute to a nascent stream of literature that relativizes the usefulness of mainstream characteristics in asset pricing models.},

@article{AndreLeCourtoisSu20a,
	abstract = {This paper examines the structure of optimal insurance contracts for a broad class of insureds that includes both risk averters and risk lovers and by assuming that the insureds are prudent. We specify the difference in optimal contract form between risk averters and risk lovers. Treating these decision-makers as a unique group, we show that the optimal insurance form is dual limited stop-loss insurance with an upper limit, which implies that including risk lovers in the group of decision-makers changes the contract in the small loss part. We also consider the situation of contracts with a concave payoff, where the optimal contract form becomes limited change-loss insurance or limited dual change-loss insurance depending on the coefficient of variation of the retained loss. Finally, we derive the form of optimal contracts in the presence of a background risk.},
