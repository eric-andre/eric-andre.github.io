<p>I am an Assistant Professor at emlyon business school in Lyon, France and a former interest rates options trader for some large European banks in Paris, New-York and London.</p>
<p>I hold a diplôme d’Ingénieur (MEng) from École Centrale Paris with a concentration in Applied Mathematics and a PhD in Economics from Aix-Marseille University.</p>
<p>At emlyon business school I teach Quantitative Finance and Statistics courses, both in emlyon’s <a href='https://masters.em-lyon.com/en/msc-in-management-grande-ecole'>MSc in Management</a> and in its <a href='https://masters.em-lyon.com/en/msc-finance-en'>MSc in Finance</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a member of the <a href='https://aim.em-lyon.com/quant/'>QUANT</a> research center. My research focuses on applications of the theory of decision under ambiguity ‒with its links to Bayesian and robust statistics‒ to the management of risks related to financial markets. I also have a keen interest in statistical arbitrage and in applications of machine learning to finance.</p>
